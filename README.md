## A2-230
CS-230 A2 project

> **Getting Started**

To run the game, unzip the project files, then run this command in the command line (making sure you're in the current directory of the unzipped folder):

cd Group18-A2/source && java -jar A2-230.jar

However, you can also in launch in your preferred IDE. Follow the following path to get to the main class:

Group18-A2/source/src/com.group18/Main.java

After this, you need to run/compile the main class, in order to get the game running.
